Q) How did viewing a diff between two 
versions helps you see the bug
that was introduced?
A) As we are able to view only those 
lines which are having differences and
able to compare them sequencially.
Q)How could having easy access to the 
entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?
A)We can track back all the characterstics
of are code which were before and not now,
this can help us adding new features based
on previous one or restoring the past features.
Q)What do you think are the pros and cons of
manually choosing when to create a commit, 
like you do in Git, vs having versions 
automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
A)As the developer knows best that when to
commit a project or not,thus manual commit is
always better than automatic.
Q)Why do you think some version control 
systems, like Git, allow saving multiple 
files in one commit, while others, like Google
 Docs, treat each file separately?
A)Git treats all files as a part of project,
thus saving all of the files are assumed connected
and need to reflect changes done in any of the
files while other versions are made for independent
files.
Q)How can you use the commands git log and git
 diff to view the history of files?
A)By typing them in Git Bash
Q)How might using version control make you more
 confident to make changes that could break something?
A)When we know that we can overcome our mistakes 
at any point in time then we do feel confident
making changes which can actually bring something 
fruitful
Q)Now that you have your workspace set up, what do 
you want to try using Git for?
